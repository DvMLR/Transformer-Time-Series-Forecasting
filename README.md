# Attention Mechanisms for Time Series Forecasting

This project builds upon previous research involving the use of LSTMs for anomaly detection at DTU. Where the previous project had difficulties capturing long sequences, and struggled from the vanishing gradient problem, the hypothesis for this project is that these issues can be resolved using modern techniques in Attention Mechanisms.
